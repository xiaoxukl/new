<h1>The World's First National Park</h1>
<p>
On March 1, 1872, Yellowstone became the first national park for all to enjoy the unique hydrothermal and geologic features. 
Within Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres,  visitors have <br> unparalleled opportunities to observe wildlife in an intact ecosystem, explore geothermal areas
that contain about half the world's active geysers, and view geologic wonders like the <br> Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River.
